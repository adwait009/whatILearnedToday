To send data from external mqtt broker to thingsboard 

1. First of all we will create an instance of mqtt broker
Here I have created instance of RabbitMQ broker.
You can create an instance by going on the below link
https://api.cloudamqp.com/

Once you create an instance you will see the Mqtt details section,
where you will get the information about host, port, username, password, etc

2. We will use Mosquitto to send the data on this RabbitMQ broker 

Install Mosquitto for your OS,
go to that directory open cmd here and run the below command.

mosquitto_pub -h broker.hivemq.com -p 1883 -t "tb/mqtt-integration-tutorial/sensors/SN-001/temperature" -m '{\"value\":25.1}' -u username -P password -d

You should use your hostname which you will get after creating instance on RabbitMQ instead of broker.hivemq.com

3. Refer MQTT Integration Configuration on Thingsboard for knowing how to connect your rabbit broker to thingsboard.
